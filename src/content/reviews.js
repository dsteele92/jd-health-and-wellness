		review: 'I came to JD Health and Wellness seeking a fresh and comprehensive approach to my healthcare needs. I have been seeing Dr. Boyd, and with each visit I am even more glad I made her my primary care physician. She is extremely thorough, and I always feel listened to and leave with a smile on my face. The entire staff has been welcoming, professional, and attentive. As a regular patient, I have confidence that I will be treated with the utmost care throughout my entire visit. I am so glad I decided to become a patient there.',

		review: 'Anna Boyd has been my primary care physician for going on 5 years. She takes time to listen and hear what your saying. Dr. Boyd really cares about her patients.  Dr. Boyd has taken time to call and check on me when I was very ill and in ICU. In my opinion there is not a better Dr out there. The office staff is attentive and professional.',

		review: 'I am a patient of both Anna Boyd, N.D., and Eric Davis. I began my new journey in life 16 months ago after hitting rock bottom in life. Over the last year and a half of being a patient at JD Health and Wellness Center, I have received nothing but the most amazing care. Up until the time I began my Healthcare and Therapy at JD Healthcare, I never thought I would be where I am in my current life and had never had such a wonderful fit with a Therapist and Physician in all my years of struggle with severe Depression and Anxiety and much much more. The teamwork Eric, Dr. Boyd and the current addition of my care team (Jackie) is extraordinary. To have a Physician and Therapist that work so well together to meet the needs of a patient in dire need. I have never had a Therapist that I can reach out to day or night and even on weekends in which if I have needed to contact, that I can send a text to or have a Physician to page that make you feel you matter and your not a bother too.		I consider my care team not only my Healthcare Providers, they have become a huge part of my life and apart of my family. When down and out, feeling like theres no Hope insight, I can walk into their office in tears and having a difficult time in life or a bad day, I leave there with a smile and truly know my wellbeing is extremely important to them and I am not wasting their time. The best part of my ups and downs in life or heavy bumps in the road, I survived them from the wonderful support I have been provided with. I am truly blessed by each and everyone whom is apart of JD Health and Wellness Center. I would recommend if a patient is in need of an amazing Therapist or in search of a excellent Physician, JD Health and Wellness Center is where I would recommend to establish a new patient appointment. You will receive nothing but the BEST care by this amazing team! I cant even Thank each of them enough or express enough words for how great full I am each and every single day! They were brought into my life for an amazing reason and I Pray each day that this team of Healthcare will exist together for a very long time! I dont know what I would do or where I would be if it wasnt for each and everyone there!',
